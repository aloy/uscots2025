    "text": "Tuning a KNN Model\nTo tune a model, we must first define our model, which includes specifying the recipe and the model specification, and then combining these components into a workflow. There is one key change required, however, to perform parameter tuning: we need to use the tune() function to indicate which parameter we want to tune in our model specification. In the case of KNN, we set neighbors = tune() rather than setting it to a specific value.\n\n# Recipe definition\nknn_recipe &lt;- recipe(monster_real ~ imdb + year_aired, data = scooby_train) |&gt;\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) |&gt;\n  step_naomit(all_predictors())\n\n# Model specification\nknn_spec &lt;- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = tune()) |&gt;\n  set_mode(\"classification\") |&gt;\n  set_engine(\"kknn\")\n\n# Workflow definition\nknn_wflow &lt;- workflow() |&gt;\n  add_recipe(knn_recipe) |&gt;\n  add_model(knn_spec)\n\nNext, we need to create our cross-validation splits. In this example, let’s use 5-fold cross-validation.\n\n# Cross-validation splits\nscooby_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(scooby_train, v = 5, strata = monster_real)\n\nWe also need to create a grid of values for the neighbors parameter, for example from 1 to 21 (odds only), using the grid_regular() function. We then pass this grid to the tune_grid() function along with our workflow and cross-validation folds. When tuning a single parameter you could also create a tibble with the values you want to test, but using grid_regular() is a convenient way to generate a range of values and makes tuning multiple parameters easier.\n\nk_grid &lt;- grid_regular(neighbors(range = c(1, 21)), levels = 10)\n\nNote: {tidymodels} does have functionality to automatically generate candidate parameter grids for many models; however, it’s better to manually specify the values when you are first learning to reinforce your understanding of the parameters and their impact on model performance.\nWith the grid defined, we can now perform the tuning process by passing in the workflow, the cross-validation folds, and the grid of values to the tune_grid() function. We also specify the metrics we will use to evaluate the model’s performance, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Recall that we use the metric_set() to combine multiple metrics into a single object that can be passed to the tuning function.\n\nscooby_tune &lt;- tune_grid(\n  knn_wflow,\n  resamples = scooby_folds,\n  grid = k_grid,\n  metrics = metric_set(accuracy, sens, spec)\n)\n\nTo collect the results of the tuning process, we use the collect_metrics() function.

What is the best value of k based on the accuracy metric? How does this value compare to the sensitivity and specificity metrics?\nIt can be tedious to explore the table of results manually, particularly if you have many parameters to tune. To quickly visualize the results we use the autoplot() function from the {tune} package. This function will create a plot of the performance metrics for each value of our parameters, allowing us to quickly identify the best performing model.\nYour turn 2: Use the autoplot() function to visualize the results of the tuning process. What does the plot tell you about the relationship between the number of neighbors and the model’s performance?\nIf your goal is to select the “best” value of k, you can use the select_best() function to extract the best performing parameter value based on a specific metric. For example, if you want to select the best value of k based on accuracy, you can do the following:\n\nbest_k &lt;- select_best(scooby_tune, metric = \"accuracy\")\n\nThis will return a tibble with the best value of k and its corresponding accuracy.\nYour turn 3: What is the best value of k based on sensitivity?

Let’s see it in action:\n\nfit_resamples(scooby_knn_wf1, scooby_folds)\n\n# Resampling results\n# 10-fold cross-validation \n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   splits           id     .metrics         .notes          \n   &lt;list&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;list&gt;           &lt;list&gt;          \n 1 &lt;split [337/38]&gt; Fold01 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 2 &lt;split [337/38]&gt; Fold02 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 3 &lt;split [337/38]&gt; Fold03 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 4 &lt;split [337/38]&gt; Fold04 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 5 &lt;split [337/38]&gt; Fold05 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 6 &lt;split [338/37]&gt; Fold06 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 7 &lt;split [338/37]&gt; Fold07 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 8 &lt;split [338/37]&gt; Fold08 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n 9 &lt;split [338/37]&gt; Fold09 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n10 &lt;split [338/37]&gt; Fold10 &lt;tibble [3 × 4]&gt; &lt;tibble [0 × 3]&gt;\n\n\nNotice that the output is 10 by 4 tibble, where three of the columns have nested tibbles inside. An easier way to interact with this dataset is by using the function collect_metrics() which summarizes some performance metrics across our cross-validation dataset:\n\nfit_resamples(scooby_knn_wf1, scooby_folds) |&gt;\n  collect_metrics()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  .metric     .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 accuracy    binary     0.848    10  0.0287 Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 brier_class binary     0.118    10  0.0215 Preprocessor1_Model1\n3 roc_auc     binary     0.857    10  0.0331 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nIt seems however that the default metrics don’t include specificity and sensitivity so we will create a new set of metrics using metric_set, which we add as a parameter in fit_resamples()\n\nmulti_metric &lt;- metric_set(accuracy, sens, spec)\nfit_resamples(scooby_knn_wf1, scooby_folds, \n              metrics = multi_metric) |&gt;\n  collect_metrics()\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  .metric  .estimator  mean     n std_err .config             \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n1 accuracy binary     0.848    10  0.0287 Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 sens     binary     0.934    10  0.0209 Preprocessor1_Model1\n3 spec     binary     0.552    10  0.0521 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nYour turn 5: Using your 10-fold cross validations evaluate your accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for KNN models using k = 10, 50, 150.\n\nWhich value would you use to maximize accuracy?\nHow about sensitivity?",

    "text": "Data set\nThis activity is inspired by the following blog post from Julia Silge. We will be using a data set collected from the popular animated series, Scooby Doo. Specifically, we’ll build a KNN model to predict whether a monster is real or not.\nTo begin, you can load the data\n\nscooby &lt;- read_csv(\"scooby.csv\", col_types = \"ddfcd\")\n\nand take a glimpse() at it:\n\nglimpse(scooby)\n\nRows: 501\nColumns: 5\n$ year_aired      &lt;dbl&gt; 1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, 1969, …\n$ imdb            &lt;dbl&gt; 8.1, 8.1, 8.0, 7.8, 7.5, 8.4, 7.6, 8.2, 8.1, 8.0, 8.5,…\n$ monster_real    &lt;fct&gt; fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, …\n$ title           &lt;chr&gt; \"What a Night for a Knight\", \"A Clue for Scooby Doo\", …\n$ suspects_amount &lt;dbl&gt; 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, …\n\n\nTeaching note: This is a “clean” version of the data set. If you want to see the original data set, you can load it from the Tidy Tuesday Github Repo. The original data set has some missing values, many logical columns that should be converted to more useful factor variables, and many columns not used in this analysis. If you want to focus on the full data analysis cycle, then you could start with the this raw data set.\nNow that the data set is loaded, let’s split our data set into a training and testing set. We’ll use 75% of the data for training and 25% for testing. We will also stratify our data set by the monster_real column to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar breakdown of real and fake monsters.\n\n# Be sure to run the setup chunk at the top of the document first!\nset.seed(1234)\nscooby_split &lt;- initial_split(scooby, prop = 0.75, strata = monster_real)\nscooby_train &lt;- training(scooby_split)\nscooby_test &lt;- testing(scooby_split)",

    "text": "Classification and KNN\nWe are interested in determining whether the monster in the episode is real or fake. To do this we will use the year that the episode was aired (year_aired) and the rating the episode got on imdb.\nYour turn 1: Create a scatterplot of imdb_rating vs. year and color the points by real_monster. What do you observe?\nYour turn 2: A KNN classifier assigns a new observation a label based on the labels of the k closest observations using a majority vote. In the scatterplot below there are two new observations marked with a black x. For each of the new observations, determine whether a KNN classifier would label the observation as a real monster or not based on the following values of k:\n\nk = 1\nk = 3\nk = 5\n\nReflection questions:\n\nDid you choose the closest neighbors based on the year_aired or the imdb_rating or a combination of the two?\nWere there any major difficulties in deciding on the closest observations?\n\nYour turn 3: Quantitative variables should be standardized (normalized) before training (fitting) a KNN classifier. Explain in your own words why this is recommended.\n\nA little more data wrangling\nBefore going any farther we should standardize the predictor variables. When making predictions we want to use the same data wrangling steps, and use the mean and standard deviations from the training set to standardize the predictor variables in the testing set to avoid “data leakage”. To do this, we will create a recipe using the {recipes} package from the {tidymodels} framework. A recipe is a way to specify a sequence of data wrangling steps that can be applied to a data set. The recipe will be used to prepare the training data set, and then it will be “baked” to apply the same steps to the testing data set. This ensures that the same transformations are applied to both training and testing data sets, which is crucial for model performance.\nTo begin a recipe, specify a formula that describes the response variable and the predictor variables. The response variable is placed to the left of the ~ and the predictors are placed on the right separated by +. Additional data processing steps are added with step_*() functions. For example, the step_naomit() function allows us to remove rows with missing values and the step_normalize() function allows us to standardize the variables.\n\n# Recipe definition\nknn_recipe &lt;- recipe(monster_real ~ imdb + year_aired, data = scooby_train) |&gt;\n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) |&gt;\n  step_naomit(all_predictors())\n\nTo view the results, we need to prep() and bake() the recipe. The prep() function prepares the recipe by calculating the necessary statistics (e.g., means and standard deviations) from the training data set, and the bake() function applies the same transformations to the training and testing data sets.\n\nprep(knn_recipe, training = scooby_train) |&gt;\n  bake(new_data = scooby_train)\n\n# A tibble: 375 × 3\n    imdb year_aired monster_real\n   &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;       \n 1 1.04       -1.57 fake        \n 2 0.636      -1.57 fake        \n 3 1.44       -1.57 fake        \n 4 0.369      -1.57 fake        \n 5 0.904      -1.57 fake        \n 6 1.17       -1.57 fake        \n 7 1.44       -1.57 fake        \n 8 1.04       -1.57 fake        \n 9 1.44       -1.57 fake        \n10 0.904      -1.51 fake        \n# ℹ 365 more rows\n\n\nYour turn 4: Create a scatterplot of imdb_rating vs year and color the points by real_monster using the updated (normalized) scooby_train data set.\n\n\nFitting a KNN classifier in the {tidymodels} framework\nNow that we have our data set ready, and we are familiar with the intuition behind KNN for classification, we can fit a KNN classifier using the {tidymodels} framework. For now, let’s assume we are interested in k = 3 nearest neighbors.\nAs in a KNN regression model we create a model specification using the nearest_neighbor() function. The key difference in the specification for a classification model is that we set the mode to \"classification\" instead of \"regression\".\n\n# Model specification\nknn_spec &lt;- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 3) |&gt;\n  set_mode(\"classification\") |&gt;\n  set_engine(\"kknn\")\n\nAs with KNN regression we next create a workflow, which combines a model specification and a recipe into a single object.\n\n# Workflow definition\nknn_wflow &lt;- workflow() |&gt;\n  add_recipe(knn_recipe) |&gt;\n  add_model(knn_spec)\n\nFinally, we fit our model to the training set using the fit() function.\n\n# Model training\n(knn_model &lt;- fit(knn_wflow, data = scooby_train))\n\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: nearest_neighbor()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2 Recipe Steps\n\n• step_normalize()\n• step_naomit()\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCall:\nkknn::train.kknn(formula = ..y ~ ., data = data, ks = min_rows(3,     data, 5))\n\nType of response variable: nominal\nMinimal misclassification: 0.1333333\nBest kernel: optimal\nBest k: 3\n\n\n\n\nMaking predictions and evaluating performance\nTo obtain the predicted class labels we can use the augment() function, which adds columns for the predicted class labels (.pred_class), the predicted probabilities of an observation being in that class (.pred_fake and .pred_real here) to the specified data set.\n\naugment(knn_model, new_data = scooby_test)\n\n# A tibble: 126 × 8\n   .pred_class .pred_fake .pred_real year_aired  imdb monster_real title        \n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;        \n 1 fake                 1          0       1969   8.1 fake         What a Night…\n 2 fake                 1          0       1969   8   fake         Hassle in th…\n 3 fake                 1          0       1969   7.5 fake         Decoy for a …\n 4 fake                 1          0       1969   8.2 fake         Foul Play in…\n 5 fake                 1          0       1969   8.1 fake         The Backstag…\n 6 fake                 1          0       1969   8.5 fake         A Gaggle of …\n 7 fake                 1          0       1970   8.7 fake         A Night of F…\n 8 fake                 1          0       1970   8.3 fake         Nowhere to H…\n 9 fake                 1          0       1970   8.5 fake         Jeepers, It'…\n10 fake                 1          0       1970   7.9 fake         A Tiki Scare…\n# ℹ 116 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: suspects_amount &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nYour turn 5: Use the augment() function and fill in the plotting template to create a jittered scatterplot of the predicted probabilities of being a real monster (.pred_real) vs. the predicted probabilities of being a fake monster (.pred_fake). Color the points by monster_real. What do you observe?\nYour turn 6: The below code creates a table of the predicted class labels and the actual class labels. What is the accuracy of your model? Report both the numeric value and give an interpretation of what accuracy means.\n\naugment(knn_model, new_data = scooby_test) |&gt;\n  count(monster_real, .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  monster_real .pred_class     n\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 fake         fake           92\n2 fake         real            6\n3 real         fake           15\n4 real         real           13\n\naugment(knn_model, new_data = scooby_test) |&gt;\n  conf_mat(truth = monster_real, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction fake real\n      fake   92   15\n      real    6   13\n\n\nYour turn 7: Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified (the true positive rate).\n\nWhat is a positive prediction in this KNN model?\nHow do we interpret sensitivity in this context?\nCan you think of an example where sensitivity is more important than accuracy?\nUse the above table to calculate the sensitivity of your model.\n\nYour turn 8: Specificity is the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified (the true negative rate).\n\nWhat is a negative prediction in this KNN model?\nHow do we interpret specificity in this context?\nCan you think of an example where specificity is more important than accuracy?\nUse the above table to calculate the specificity of your model.\n\nWhile you should be able to calculate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity “by hand” from a summary table, the {yardstick} package (loaded with {tidymodels}) provides a number of functions to calculate these metrics. For example, the accuracy() function takes a tibble with the predicted class labels and the actual class labels as arguments and returns the accuracy of the model. Similarly, the sensitivity() (also sens()) and specificity() (spec()) functions take a tibble with the predicted class labels and the actual class labels as arguments and return the sensitivity and specificity of the model, respectively.\nRun the below code to check your calculations from above.\n\nscooby_test_aug &lt;- augment(knn_model, new_data = scooby_test)\nscooby_test_aug |&gt; accuracy(truth = monster_real, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 accuracy binary         0.833\n\nscooby_test_aug |&gt; sensitivity(truth = monster_real, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 sensitivity binary         0.939\n\nscooby_test_aug |&gt; specificity(truth = monster_real, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 specificity binary         0.464\n\n\nNote: We can also make predictions for all observations in the testing data set using the predict() function. The predict() function takes a fitted model object and a new data set as arguments, and it returns a tibble with the predicted class labels as the only column. While we will typically use augment() to get the predicted class labels along with the original data set, predict() is useful when we only want the predicted class labels.\n\npredict(knn_model, new_data = scooby_test)\n\n# A tibble: 126 × 1\n   .pred_class\n   &lt;fct&gt;      \n 1 fake       \n 2 fake       \n 3 fake       \n 4 fake       \n 5 fake       \n 6 fake       \n 7 fake       \n 8 fake       \n 9 fake       \n10 fake       \n# ℹ 116 more rows",
