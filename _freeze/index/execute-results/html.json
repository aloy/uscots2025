You can use the below code chunk to do this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidymodels\", \"tidyverse\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Agenda\n\n- Introductions\n- Overview of {tidymodels}\n- Activity: KNN for regression/prediction\n- Activity: KNN for classification\n- Break\n- Overview of parameter tuning via cross validation and activity\n- Overview of grid search and activity\n- Debrief and Q&A\n\n## Workshop materials\n\nYou can access the materials either through the Google drive folder or the Github repo. Choose what you're most comfortable with. We recommend creating a new RStudio project (.Rproj) for the workshop so that it's easy to store the data and .Rmd files in the same directory.\n\n* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XeuSeFVvpfnjBDiEtg27bp3AK-6R0cIXXWxFTyTbX6Q/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [Google drive folder](https://bit.ly/uscots2025-tidymodels)\n* [Github repo](https://github.com/aloy/face-grant2025)\n\n\n## Resources\n\nHere are additional resources that we found useful as we prepared to teach with {tidymodels}:\n\n* [{tidymodels} website](https://www.tidymodels.org/): The official website for the {tidymodels} ecosystem\n* [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/): Book by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge\n* [Julia Silge's blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/): Blog posts on various {tidymodels} topics\n* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)\n\n",
