Let's start by loading the dataset\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##Need to upload file\nmn_police_tbl <- read_csv(\"police_weekly.mn.csv\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 104 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (3): week, year, tot\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOur dataset only has three variables:\n\n* `week`: Week in the year, e.g. 1,2,...,52.\n* `year`: Year, our dataset only has years 2016 and 2017.\n* `tot`: The number of total police incidents reported that week.\n\nWe can look at the number of incidents in different weeks across 2016 and 2017, as follows\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(mn_police_plot <- mn_police_tbl |>\n  mutate(year = as.factor(year)) |>\n  ggplot(aes(week, tot, color = year))+\n  geom_point(size = .5)+\n  labs(x = \"Week of the year\",\n       y = \"Incidents\")+\n  facet_wrap(~year))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](1_knn_prediction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Your turn 1**: Add a linear trend to `mn_police_plot`. Do you think the linear trend is a good approximation to your data? \n\n\n**Your turn 2**: Add a trend line using `geom_smooth` (without specifying `method`) to `mn_police_plot`. Compare and contrast this plot with the one from the previous question. Which of the two trends better fit the data?\n\n\n# The prediction problem and the KNN model\n\nWe are interested in predicting the number of police incidents in a particular week of the year in Minneapolis. Since we want our model to be applicable across years we will use the following strategy:\n\n* We will divide our dataset into a training dataset and a testing dataset. We will use the year *2016* as our training and *2017* will be our testing.\n\n* We will build a model using our training dataset (*2016*)\n\n* We will evaluate how good our model is using our testing dataset (*2017*)\n\n## Creating testing/training datasets\n\nWe start by generating our training/testing datasets:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrain_mn_police_tbl <- mn_police_tbl |>\n  filter(year == 2016)\ntest_mn_police_tbl <- mn_police_tbl |>\n  filter(year == 2017)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## KNN models\n\nFor our first prediction model we will use a \"K Nearest Neighbors\" (KNN) model. Prediction in a KNN model works by averaging the response variable across the $k$ closest observations from your training dataset. Notice than in a KNN model we need to specify the value of $k$.\n\n\n**Your turn 3**: With your neighbor, discuss how a KNN model would work to predict the number of incidents for week `20` using $k=3$. Use R to calculate the model prediction.\n\n\n## Using {tidymodels} to implement a KNN model\n\nIn the following code we will introduce how to implement a KNN model using {tidymodels}. After showing the code, We will explain in detail:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Library setup\nlibrary(tidymodels)\ntidymodels_prefer(quiet = TRUE)\nlibrary(kknn)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model specification\nkNear <- 3\nknn_spec <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = kNear, \n                             weight_func =\"rectangular\") |>\n  set_mode(\"regression\") |>\n  set_engine(\"kknn\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Recipe definition\nknn_recipe <- recipe(tot ~ week, data=train_mn_police_tbl)\n\n# Workflow definition\nknn_wflow <- workflow() |>\n  add_recipe(knn_recipe) |>\n  add_model(knn_spec)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model training\nknn_model <- fit(knn_wflow, train_mn_police_tbl)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's go into the details of how the above code works:\n\n1. **Library setup**: First, we tell R that we will be using the {tidymodels} framework, that we would like to resolve conflicts between {tidymodels} and other libraries without having warnings and that we will be using {kknn}, a library that implements the KNN model.\n\n2. **Model specification**: Next, we tell R to use a `nearest_neighor()` model (a KNN model), that we are setting our nearest-neighbor parameter to 3 and the weight function to `rectangular` (each observation weighs the same), that we are in the regression mode (as opposed to `classification`, more details on this in the upcoming classes), since we are predicting a numerical variable (`tot` is a number), and that we will be using the {kknn} library.\n\n3. **Recipe definition**: We declare response variable (`tot`) and the explanatory variable (`week`) in a *recipe*. Notice that in R the notation `y ~ x` means that `y` is your response variable and `x` is your explanatory variable.\n\n4. **Workflow definition**: We are combine our model specification and recipe into a single unit called a *workflow*. Our workflow will be called `knn_wflow`\n\n5. **Model training**: Finally, we *fit* (or create) our model based on our training dataset.\n\nAlthough the syntax might strike you as verbose at first, the advantage of {tidymodels} is that we use the **same** syntax no matter what type of model we use.\n\nBefore moving on, take a look at `knn_model` object and notice some of the parameters that we used:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknn_model\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n══ Workflow [trained] ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: nearest_neighbor()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n0 Recipe Steps\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nCall:\nkknn::train.kknn(formula = ..y ~ ., data = data, ks = min_rows(3,     data, 5), kernel = ~\"rectangular\")\n\nType of response variable: continuous\nminimal mean absolute error: 26.67308\nMinimal mean squared error: 1088.703\nBest kernel: rectangular\nBest k: 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Evaluating our KNN model\n\n**Your turn 4: ** Run the following code and describe what you think `augment()` is doing. How many additional columns are added to `test_mn_police_tbl` and what do they mean? What are the type/dimensions of your output? Where in the output are themodel's predictions? Check the documentation for [augment](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/augment.html) and double-check your answers.\n\n\n**Your turn 5:** Use `augment()` on your testing dataset (`test_mn_police_tbl`) and create a plot illustrating the number of reports per week with your predictions superimposed. How well does your model predict the reported values in 2017?\n\n\n\n**Your turn 6:** Repeat the previous exercise but **use your training dataset (`train_mn_police_tbl`) this time**. How well does your model predict the reported values in 2016? Why do you think the model is doing better for 2016?\n\n\n**Your turn 7:** One way to measure the fit of a regression model is to calculate the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**, which can be interpreted as the standard deviation of the residuals (the difference between the model and the observed value). Notice that the RMSE has the same units as the response variable. Check the documentation for `rmse()` (in the console: `?rmse`) and use it to calculate the RMSE of the model on the testing and training datasets. Are your results consistent with exercises 5 and 6?\n\n\n# Wrapping up: Leveraging {usemodels}\n\nThe steps for defining the model, creating a recipe, and creating a workflow can be onerous at times. Luckily, {usemodels} creates code templates that you can modify. To create  KNN template we use the `use_kknn()` function, specifying the model formula (`tot ~ week`), the name of the training set (`train_mn_police_tbl`), and whether or not we are optimizing parameters (`tune = FALSE`).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(usemodels)\nuse_kknn(tot ~ week, train_mn_police_tbl, tune = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nkknn_recipe <- \n  recipe(formula = tot ~ week, data = train_mn_police_tbl) %>% \n  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% \n  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) \n\nkknn_spec <- \n  nearest_neighbor() %>% \n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>% \n  set_engine(\"kknn\") \n\nkknn_workflow <- \n  workflow() %>% \n  add_recipe(kknn_recipe) %>% \n  add_model(kknn_spec) \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can customize this code as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkknn_recipe <- \n  recipe(formula = tot ~ week, data = train_mn_police_tbl) \n\nkknn_spec <- \n  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 3, \n                   weight_func =\"rectangular\") |>\n  set_mode(\"regression\") |>\n  set_engine(\"kknn\") \n\nkknn_workflow <- \n  workflow() |>\n  add_recipe(kknn_recipe) |>\n  add_model(kknn_spec) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn particular, we made the following changes:\n\n* We use the new pipe symbol (`|>`).\n* We removed the pre-processing steps from the recipe (`step_zv()` and `step_normalize`) since we haven't talked about them yet (more details in our next worksheet).\n* We added options for `neighbors` and `weight_func` in the model specification.\n* Our response variable is numerical so in the model specification we change the mode from `\"classification\"` to `\"regresssion\"`\n\nFinally, let's fit our model to our training and evaluate the `rmse` using our testing:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkknn_model <- fit (kknn_workflow, train_mn_police_tbl) #Fitting the model\naugment(kknn_model, test_mn_police_tbl) |> #Calculate rmse on testing\n  rmse(tot, .pred)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\n1 rmse    standard        55.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
